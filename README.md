# chalet-examples

Cross-platform examples projects grouped as externalDependencies & sub-projects.

This repository showcases how to setup a [Chalet](https://www.chalet-work.space) project with Chalet sub-projects.

To get started, [download Chalet](https://www.chalet-work.space/download), check out some of the documentation for it, and either build with the various commands from the command line, or try out the [Chalet VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chalet-org.vscode-chalet) (recommended).

At the moment, this pulls down other Chalet example repositories, and is only intended to teach and debug Chalet features.
